Our research is focused on the intersection area of organic chemistry and materials science with emphasis on the synthesis and understanding of organic materials with novel electronic and optical properties. Our overarching philosophy is to take an interdisciplinary approach to the exploration of the relationships between chemical structure and physical properties of resulting materials.  New chemical synthetic methodologies are developed to facilitate design and discovery of new materials for organic solar cells, organic electronics, water splitting, and other practical applications.
